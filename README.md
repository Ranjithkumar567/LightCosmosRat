# LightCosmosRat
A remote administration tool for Windows, written in C#
The main program has two different buttons
the start listening which opens a server on your computer on a port that you choose
the client maker which allows you to create clients that will try to connect to the ip and the port
the you gave when created. Open the client on a computer that you want to remote control and you'll be able
to see the screen everytime you desire.
I am not responsible for the use that you will do with this program, i made it just for fun.
